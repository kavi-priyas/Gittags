Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to collaborate efficiently. 
Remote repositories, hosted on platforms like GitHub and GitLab, enable teams to work on projects from different locations. 
By pushing local changes to a remote repository, developers can maintain a centralized codebase.
Cloning a repository, making modifications, and submitting pull requests facilitate seamless teamwork.
